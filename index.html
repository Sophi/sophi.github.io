                <div class="why-text">
                    <p>Your team is too close to the product. You've been living with its quirks for months. You know the workarounds. You've rationalized the compromises.</p>
                    <p>But your customers won't. They'll notice immediately. They'll return it. They'll write reviews. They'll tweet about it.</p>
                    <p>An external validation catches what internal testing misses:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Real-world usage patterns you didn't anticipate</li>
                        <li>Edge cases that seem "unlikely" but happen constantly</li>
                        <li>Compatibility issues across different environments</li>
                        <li>User experience problems that seem obvious in hindsight</li>
                        <li>The small details that separate good products from great ones</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="emphasis">Better to catch it before launch than explain it after.</p>
